		Welcome to my Web Folio! Here are links to some of the recent personal projects I have done
		while learning web development. You can also find a link to my GitHub page which contains some
		of the repos for these projects, along with others I am working on, and some from when I started
		learning too. Some of these sites are hosted on Netlify using GitHub for integration. Above you
		will find a link to my resum√©. Thanks for stopping by!
