## Freelance Graphic Designer & Web Developer looking for a Job

I have worked as a freelancer for over 20 years while raising my kids. They are grown and I am ready to start the next phase of my life. I want to do the work, solve the problems and implement solutions using programming. I am an excellent student and I am always learning new things, and I am confident I can get the hang of any language, framework, compiler, architecture or development process. I am able to focus, I am detail oriented and don't give up easily.

I have built a lot of websites over the past twenty years including 4 e-commerce sites. I have used DreamWeaver, Wordpress, WooCommerce, Weebly, Wix and now I am using programming languages and other development tools. As a graphic designer I am also well versed in using Photoshop, Illustrator, Publisher and other Adobe products, though a little rusty because I have not used them for a few years.

I received an A.S. degree in Graphic Design(3.7 GPA) from State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota (previously Manatee Community College) in 2000. Aside from freelancing I have also worked as a fine-artist, sold books online and done volunteer work in my community.
